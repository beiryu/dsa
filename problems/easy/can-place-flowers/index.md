You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return `true` *if* `n` *new flowers can be planted in the* `flowerbed` *without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and* `false` *otherwise*.

Sure, here are two TypeScript solutions for the problem:

**Solution 1: Iterative Approach**

```tsx
function canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed: number[], n: number): boolean {
    for(let i = 0; i < flowerbed.length && n > 0; i++) {
        if(flowerbed[i] === 0 && (i === 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] === 0) && (i === flowerbed.length - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] === 0)) {
            flowerbed[i] = 1;
            n--;
        }
    }
    return n === 0;
}

```

Time Complexity: O(m), where m is the length of the flowerbed. This is because we are traversing the array once.
Space Complexity: O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space.

**Solution 2: Early Return Approach**

```tsx
function canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed: number[], n: number): boolean {
    for(let i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
        if(flowerbed[i] === 0 && (i === 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] === 0) && (i === flowerbed.length - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] === 0)) {
            flowerbed[i] = 1;
            n--;
            if(n === 0) return true;
        }
    }
    return n === 0;
}

```

Time Complexity: O(m), where m is the length of the flowerbed. This is because we are traversing the array once. However, in the best case scenario, we can return early if we have placed all the flowers.
Space Complexity: O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space.
